In October 2021, NPR podcast All Things Considered released an episode entitled “Dollar 
stores have boomed during the pandemic, which concerns some communities.” They 
explain, as many other news sources have observed, that dollar stores have grown 
increasingly popular across the United States during the coronavirus pandemic. According 
to host Sarah McMammon, “Research suggests 88% of Americans shop at dollar stores at 
least sometimes. And about 4 in 10 new store openings in the country this year are for 
dollar stores” (McCammon, et al. 2021). However, McMammon continues, not everyone is 
thrilled about this development: many people are worried that the proliferation of the 
dollar store will reduce food access to some neighborhoods, particularly those that are 
rural, non-white, and/or low-income (McCammon, et al. 2021). This is the general 
consensus at which many news outlets arrive. As NPR’s Planet Money podcast host Noel 
King contends in the episode “Dollar Stores Vs Lettuce,” “[dollar stores] are setting up in 
places that no one else will go - tiny towns, urban areas. So are they filling a need, or is the 
dollar store takeover destroying something more valuable?” (King & Gonzalez 2019). 
However, some contemporary scholars are pushing against this dominant narrative about 
who eats what in America. Sociologist Priya Fielding-Singh contends in her book How the 
Other Half Eats, released in November 2021, that the story we tell about food in America is 
often more nuanced than it is often portrayed, explaining that the story is more more 
deeply rooted in systemic injustice than people would like to think. She writes: “Because of 
the hidden power of food’s meanings, I learned that improving families’ [physical] access to 
nutritious food is only the starting point, not the solution, to ensuring nutritional equity. 
Food access is a necessary but insufficient prerequisite” (Fielding-Singh 2021, 247).
